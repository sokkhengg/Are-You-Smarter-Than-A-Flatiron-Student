# Flatiron Phase 2 Project

## Quiz App

As a user, I want to:

* Select the level of difficulty of the questions and start the quiz
* Get random 10 questions, one by one, and see 4 answer options for the question
* Skip the question if I don’t know the answer
* See the money I’ve earned, how questions I’ve answered correctly, and how many questions I skipped
* Add a question the database (persistence???)
* Switch between light and dark mode at any time.

**STRETCH GOALS**:
* User only has 10 seconds to answer a question, if no answer is clicked the next question is shown.
