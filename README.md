# Flatiron Phase 2 Project

## Quiz App

As a user, I want to:

* Pick a topic and the number of questions and then start the quiz
* Get random questions, one by one, and see 2 answer options 
* Skip the question if I don’t know the answer
* See the money I’ve earned, how many questions I’ve answered correctly, and how many questions I've skipped
* Add a question to the database
* After the quiz, save my name and results to the leaderboard

**STRETCH GOALS**:
* User only has 10 seconds to answer a question, if no answer is clicked the next question is shown.
